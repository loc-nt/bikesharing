# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

Our analysis is focusing on the population factors that impact the bike sharing model from New York Citi Bike, then comparing with Des Moines population data to find the similar patterns that would help make decision for a similar business in the city. The data includes total population, density, age, employment rate on population, employment by industries, and commuter transportation by households.

## NYC Citi Bike Facts

The first dashboard is about Citi Bike facts in NYC, showing the number of records, bike counts, customers type, and the start/end location trips by zipcode. Citi Bike has approximately 14,000 bikes utilized for 2.3M rides in a month. That means, on average, a bike could be rented for 167.65 times/month, or 5.6 times/day. In addition, 81% of the customers are subscribers. It could infer that most of the riders are NYC residents than tourists. Plus, the maps show a similar start/end location highly focused on downtown area. The reason might be that riders are mostly residents to commute between works daily, since downtown is the where most of the businesses located.

## NYC vs. Des Moines

Our analysis is mainly based on three resources: (1) [ArcGIS Hub](http://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/esri::zip-code-1/data?geometry=82.440%2C-0.073%2C31.463%2C76.663&orderBy=STATE_NAME)
, (2) [US Census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,desmoinescityiowa/PST045219), (3) [Data USA](https://datausa.io). Please view our [dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/profile/loc.nguyen2805#!/vizhome/Practice_15922039663870/CHALLENGE?publish=yes) together with the analyis.

In the population dashboard using ArcGIS Hub data, NYC population is surely higher than Des Moines. The NYC map indicates that, in the downtown area, even though having smaller population, the number of rides is about twice the population in those zipcodes. Therefore, since Des Moines downtown area has approximately 20,000 residents, we might be able to expect about 40,000 rides on average per month.

Next, ArcGIS Hub data shows that NYC desnity is evenly spreadout and much higher than Des Moines. The fact that Citi Bike is so successful in New York proves that higher desity may create higher demand for bike rental. Therefore, if we can focus on the higher densed areas in Des Moines, we can assume a relatively better revenue.

In terms of age population, NYC Citi Bike shows a significant amount of ride count on the customers whose birth year range from 1984-1988, which is in the age range of 20-34. Fortunately, also from ArcGIS Hub, Des Moines has similar percentage of population on this age range with New York (23% in Des Moines vs. 20% in New York). This could potentially be the main age market for our business model.

Another notable point is the percentage of labor force in the city. In the NYC fact, we learned that ride count is significantly higher in the downtown area, where many of the businesses is located. So the more people are under employment, the more densed its downtown becomes, thus generate higher demand for bike rental. According to US census, Des Moines has a high percent of population in labor force at 70.2%, while New York is at 63.5%. This similarity is a good support for our business model in terms of having a sustainable demand from the city labor force.

The next two dashboards show a comparison between Des Moines and New York employments by industries, thanks to the Data USA. Both cities show a very similar pattern of industries mainly focused on services rather than manufacturing industry. This might be a factor to thrive the demand of biking around the cities for work-related travel in New York, which is hopefully the same for Dos Maines when we start our own bikesharing business.

Last but not least, according to Data USA, New York city has significant high number of households commuting by bike. On the other hand, not many Des Moines citizen ride to work. Using the 'Blue Ocean' marketing strategy (the first one to enter a new market), this might be a great opportunity for us to become one of the first player in Des Moines market.

## Conclusion

This analysis is focused on population factors only, but there are many other factors that we can analyize to give a better picture of the model, such as demographics, consumers preference and habits, businesses density, city traffic and laws, etc. However, sharing business is one of the hottest trend in the market, so this is a great opportunity for us to start a new one in the beautiful Des Moines city.
